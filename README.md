# rust_tutorials

Observation:
    There are two editions of "The rust programming language"
    Fist edition and Second edition.

    Second edition is completely re-write and still under construction.
    lay foundations to understand the current documentation.
    From ref:  
    https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/index.html

    Suggestion is to read the second edition and then check the first edition later to pick up some more
    esoteric parts of the language.


Recommendataion:
    
- docs, rust tools, features, ecosystem .. and more
- cargo projects for practice
-
