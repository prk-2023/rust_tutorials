# Build Command line Application:

Idea of this document is to pool in related topics and methods that can be used to build a CLI Application,
- How to effectively use External crates 
- How to design applications 
- Include testing 
- Error handling 
- Refresh the concepts to master the thought process of coding in rust. 
- Explore more on std library and its features.

Real-world project: a CLI application by using Rust’s various features and libraries. 

Structure flow to sync with Rust programming book chapter 12. Building a CLI application:

### 1. **Creating a Workspace**

* Rust workspaces are a collection of multiple packages (crates) that can share common dependencies and 
build settings. In this chapter, you’ll set up a workspace with multiple crates:

  * **Binary crates**: These are the executable components of your application, which typically hold the
    main entry points (such as the CLI commands).

  * **Library crates**: These contain reusable code or logic that can be shared across the different binary
    crates and also the final application.

This modular setup helps with code organization and encourages you to think in terms of reusable components.
Each crate will likely have its own README.md file, which documents the purpose of that crate and how it 
fits into the bigger picture of the project.

### 2. **Skills Learned**

* **Rust package management** (via `Cargo.toml` files).

* **Modular programming**: Understanding how to split your application into smaller, logically-organized 
  crates and modules.

* **Error handling**: encounter techniques for dealing with user input and managing errors, which are core
  to creating robust CLI apps.

* **Concurrency**: If the app needs to perform tasks concurrently, you’ll learn how Rust’s concurrency model 
  (such as threads or `async`/`await`) works.

### 3. **Exploring Standard Library Features**

* The standard library is rich with utilities for building a CLI app. Some common tools you’ll use include:

  * **`std::env`** for accessing environment variables and command-line arguments.

  * **`std::fs`** for file system access (e.g., reading/writing files).

  * **`std::process`** for running system commands or handling subprocesses.

  * **`std::io`** for input and output, especially for interacting with users in a command-line context.

* These features, along with others in the `std` library, are essential for building functional and efficient 
  command-line applications.

### 4. **Other Powerful Features of Rust**

* **Cargo’s built-in testing framework**: Rust’s testing and documentation tools are an important part of 
  this chapter, ensuring that your application is properly tested and well-documented.

* **Custom error types**: In a larger CLI application, you may need to define your own error types to 
  provide more helpful feedback to users.

* **Using external crates**: The chapter may introduce crates like `clap` (a crate for command-line 
  argument parsing), `serde` (for serialization), and others to speed up development.

### 5. **Organizing Code**

* **Modular design**: Each crate focuses on a specific feature or set of features, like parsing inputs, 
  interacting with files, or managing user configurations.

* **Separation of concerns**: The library crates can focus on specific logic (e.g., business rules, data 
  processing), while the binary crates tie them together into the final CLI app.

* **README for each crate**: Having a separate README for each crate is great for documentation. 
  This will help you and others understand the purpose of each crate and how they interact with each other.

### Example of Workspace Structure:

Here’s an example of how you might structure your workspace:

```

│   ├── src/
│   │   └── main.rs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── Cargo.toml
├── bin_crate2/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── main.rs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── Cargo.toml
├── lib_crate1/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── lib.rs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── Cargo.toml
├── lib_crate2/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── lib.rs
│   ├── README.md
│   └── Cargo.toml
