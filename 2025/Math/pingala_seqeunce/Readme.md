The Pingala series is essentially a sequence where the (n)-th term represents the number of ways of
expressing (n) as the sum of 1's and 2's, which was taken by Fibonacci and later called Fibonacci sequence 
but with a slight variation in terms of interpretation. 

The Pingala sequence is sometimes referred to as the Fibonacci word sequence.

To compute the Pingala series in Rust, we can use a recursive approach, but for better performance, an 
iterative approach would be ideal.

Hereâ€™s a simple Rust function that returns the Pingala sequence up to the (n)-th term:

```rust
fn pingala_series(n: usize) -> Vec<usize> {
    let mut series = vec![0; n];
    
    // First two terms of the Pingala series
    if n > 0 {
        series[0] = 1;
    }
    if n > 1 {
        series[1] = 2;
    }
    
    // Filling up the series using the Pingala recurrence relation
    for i in 2..n {
        series[i] = series[i - 1] + series[i - 2];
    }

    series
}

fn main() {
    let n = 10;  // You can change n to whatever length you want
    let series = pingala_series(n);

    println!("Pingala Series up to {} terms:", n);
    for (i, term) in series.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("Term {}: {}", i + 1, term);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

* The `pingala_series` function computes the series up to the `n`-th term.
* It initializes the first two terms: 1 and 2.
* For the remaining terms, it follows the recurrence relation: `pingala(n) = pingala(n-1) + pingala(n-2)`, 
  which is similar to Fibonacci.
* The result is stored in a vector, and the function returns this vector.

### Example Output (for `n = 10`):

```
Pingala Series up to 10 terms:
Term 1: 1
Term 2: 2
Term 3: 3
Term 4: 5
Term 5: 8
Term 6: 13
Term 7: 21
Term 8: 34
Term 9: 55
Term 10: 89
```

You can adjust the value of `n` in the `main` function to generate as many terms as you need!
