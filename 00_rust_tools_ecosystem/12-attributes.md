# Rust Attributes:


## Intro:

- **attributes** are metadata or annotations that provide additional information to the compiler and other 
  tools. 

- They allow you to control various aspects of how Rust code behaves, such as modifying compiler behavior,
  enabling or disabling certain warnings, controlling visibility, or configuring libraries. 
  Attributes are placed above an item (function, struct, enum, etc.) and are prefixed with a `#` symbol. 

There are two primary types of attributes in Rust:

1. **Inner Attributes**: 
    These apply to the enclosing item (like a module or function) and are prefixed with `#!`.

2. **Outer Attributes**: 
    These apply directly to items and are prefixed with `#`.

### Common Uses of Rust Attributes

Here’s a breakdown of how to use Rust attributes, with examples of common use cases:

### 1. **Enabling or Disabling Warnings (Lint Attributes)**

Rust provides a way to allow or deny certain warnings using attributes. 
The most common one is `#[allow(...)]`, which silences a specific warning, and `#[deny(...)]`, which turns 
a warning into an error.

#### Example: Silencing the Unused Variable Warning
```rust
#[allow(unused_variables)]
fn main() {
    let x = 5;  // No warning for unused variable `x`
}
```

#### Example: Turning Warnings into Errors
```rust
#[deny(warnings)]
fn main() {
    let _unused_variable = 42;  // This will cause a compile-time error due to warnings being denied
}
```

### 2. **Configuration and Compiler Behavior**

You can configure compiler behavior using attributes like `#[cfg(...)]`, which enables conditional 
compilation. This is useful for platform-specific code or debugging.

#### Example: Conditional Compilation
```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
fn platform_specific_function() {
    println!("This is Linux!");
}

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
fn platform_specific_function() {
    println!("This is Windows!");
}

fn main() {
    platform_specific_function();  // This will print the appropriate message based on the target OS
}
```

### 3. **Deriving Traits Automatically**

Rust allows automatic implementation of common traits using the `#[derive(...)]` attribute. 
This is often used with traits like `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, etc.


#### Example: Deriving `Debug` and `Clone` Traits
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct MyStruct {
    name: String,
    value: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let instance = MyStruct {
        name: String::from("example"),
        value: 42,
    };

    println!("{:?}", instance);  // Prints: MyStruct { name: "example", value: 42 }
    let clone_instance = instance.clone();
    println!("{:?}", clone_instance);  // Prints: MyStruct { name: "example", value: 42 }
}
```

This automatically derives the `Debug` and `Clone` implementations for `MyStruct`.

### 4. **Visibility Control (`pub`)**

The `#[pub]` attribute controls the visibility of functions, structs, and other items in Rust. 
However, this is commonly done directly with the `pub` keyword.

#### Example: Controlling Visibility
```rust
pub struct MyStruct {
    pub name: String,
    value: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let instance = MyStruct {
        name: String::from("example"),
        value: 42,
    };

    println!("{}", instance.name);  // Accessible because 'name' is public
    // println!("{}", instance.value); // This line would cause an error because 'value' is private
}
```

### 5. **Attribute for Testing (`#[test]`)**

Rust provides an attribute to mark a function as a unit test. The test functions are run using the 
`cargo test` command.

#### Example: Writing a Test
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_addition() {
        let sum = 2 + 2;
        assert_eq!(sum, 4);  // The test will pass because 2 + 2 equals 4
    }
}
```

The `#[test]` attribute marks `test_addition` as a test function, and it will be executed when running tests 
using `cargo test`.

### 6. **Custom Attributes (Procedural Macros)**

Rust allows you to create **custom attributes** via **procedural macros**. 
These macros let you define custom behavior for attributes that operate on code at compile time.

For example, a procedural macro could automatically generate code for a custom trait implementation or 
modify how a function behaves.

```rust
// Custom derive example (simplified)
use proc_macro::TokenStream;

#[proc_macro]
pub fn custom_derive(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    // Example procedural macro implementation here
}
```

This is more advanced and requires understanding procedural macros, which are beyond the scope of simple
attribute usage but allow for very powerful code generation.

### 7. **Crate-Level Attributes**

Some attributes apply at the crate level and affect the entire crate. 
A common example is `#![allow(...)]` and `#![warn(...)]` used to configure linting for the whole crate.

#### Example: Applying Lint Attributes at the Crate Level
```rust
#![allow(dead_code)]  // Allow unused functions or code to be written without warning

fn unused_function() {
    println!("This function isn't used!");
}

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

In this case, the attribute is applied to the entire crate, meaning the unused function `unused_function` 
won’t trigger a warning.

### 8. **Attribute for Unwinding Behavior (`#[unwind]`)**

Rust allows configuring how panics should behave with the `#[unwind]` attribute. 
It determines whether a panic will cause unwinding or abort the thread.

```rust
#[unwind(allowed)]
fn may_panic() {
    panic!("This function panics!");
}
```

This attribute would control panic behavior in specific cases.

### 9. **The `#[inline]` Attribute**

The `#[inline]` attribute is used to suggest to the compiler that it should consider inlining a function, 
potentially improving performance by avoiding the overhead of a function call.

#### Example: Inlining a Function
```rust
#[inline]
fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a * b
}

fn main() {
    let result = multiply(2, 3);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

This tells the compiler that it’s beneficial to inline the `multiply` function when it’s called to reduce 
the overhead of function calls.

### Conclusion

Rust attributes provide a powerful mechanism for controlling the behavior of the compiler, enabling 
optimizations, customizing traits, and defining conditional compilation or other behaviors. 

Here’s a quick recap of common uses:

- **Linting**: `#[allow(...)]`, `#[deny(...)]` to control warnings.
- **Conditional Compilation**: `#[cfg(...)]` for platform or feature-based code.
- **Deriving Traits**: `#[derive(...)]` to automatically implement standard traits.
- **Visibility Control**: `pub` and other visibility-related attributes.
- **Testing**: `#[test]` to define unit tests.
- **Custom Macros**: Procedural macros for code generation.

Understanding and using attributes effectively helps you write more efficient, maintainable, and 
platform-specific Rust code.

# What are Attributes: ( gemini )

Attributes in Rust are a form of declarative programming. 
They are enclosed in square brackets `[...]` and placed before the item they modify, such as function,
structure , enum, or module. 

Attributes do not change the core logic of your program but rather influence the compiler's behaviour. 
They can be thought as a way to give special instructions to the compiler, similar to decorators in Python
or annotations in Java. 

## How to use Rust Attributes:

Rust uses attributes for a varity of purposes including:

- Code generation: Attributes like `#[derive(Debug)]` automatically generates code for traits, saving you from
  writing boilerplate. 

- Condition compilation: `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` lets you include or exclude code based on platform.
  This is also crucial for cross-compilation.

- Linting and Warning: `#[allow(unused_variables)]` can supress specific compiler warning for a particular
  piece of code.

- Macros: Procedural macros use attributes to transform code at compile time, creating powerful and flexible
  new syntax. 
  The `#[derive]` attribute is prime example of a procedural macro.

- External Linking: `#[link]` and `#[no_mangle]` are used when interfacing with code written in other
  languages, controlling how symbols are names and linked.

## Types of Attributes:

Attributes can be categorized based on their syntax and function:

1. Outer Attributes: These are most common type, written as `#[attribute]`. They apply to the item that
   immediately follows them. 
   Ex: `#[derive(Debug)]`

   ```rust 
   #[derive(Debug)]
   struct Book {
     name:
   }

   ```
2. Inner Attributes: These are written as `#![attribute]` and apply to the item that contains them. They
   Typically used at the top of a file or a module to apply to the entire scope. Example:`#![allow(dead_code)]`
   at the top of the file
   Ex: 

   ```rust 
       #![allow(dead_code)]
       fn main() {...}
   ```

## When are attributes used:

Attributes are used whenever you need to provide the compiler with extra information beyond the standard 
syntax. They are a fundamental tool for writing idiomatic and efficient Rust code, enabling features such 
as: 

1. Customizing behavior: 
   You use them to change how the compiler handles your code, like optimizing for performance
   (#[inline]) or marking a function as a test (#[test]).

2. Interoperability: 
   When you need to interact with C or other languages, attributes like #[no_mangle] are essential for 
   ensuring correct function names and calling conventions.

3. Building reusable components: Library authors use attributes to create powerful, 
   user-friendly APIs, like the ones provided by popular crates such as serde for serialization. 

## Example usage:

```rust 
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Book {
        title: String,
        author: String,
    }

    impl Book {
        // method that takes ownership of self
        fn consume(self) {
            println!("Consuming book: {:?}", self);
            // self goes out of scope and is dropped here
        }
        // method borrowing self immutably
        fn describe(&self) {
            println!("'{}' by {}", self.title, self.author);
        }
        // method borrowing self mutably
        fn change_title(&mut self, new_title: &str) {
            self.title = String::from(new_title);
        }
    }

    fn part5_ownership_with_structs() {
        let mut book = Book {
                            title: String::from("1984"),
                            author: String::from("George Orwell"),
                       };
        book.describe();
        book.change_title("Animal Farm");
        book.describe();
        book.consume();
        // book.describe(); // Error: book was moved
    }
```

- The main job of `#[derive(Debug)]`is to automatically generate code that will allow a type to be printed
  un a readble format for debugging. 
  In the above code it enabled "println!()" macro to use the {:?} format on a `Book` instance which is
  necessory within the `consume` method. With out this directive the code will fail to compile because 
  `Book` struct would have the `Debug` trait implemented and the {:?} format specifier would be invalid for
  it.

- Traits and `derive`: Traits are similar to an interface in other languages, defining a set of behaviours a
  type must implement. The `derive` attribute is a convenient way to ask the compiler to automatically
  generate a basic implementation of a trit for a struct or enum , saving programmer from writing the boiler
  plate code.

- `std::fmt::Debug`: This specific trait is a key component of Rust's formatting system. It defines a method
  `fmt` that formats a value for debugging. The implementation generated by `#[derive(Debug)]` will print
  the struct's name and all of its fields along with their values, which is extremely useful for inspecting
  the state of a variable during development.

## Declarative programming:
    Programming paradigm where you describe what you want to achive rather then how to achieve it. 
    Instead of giving step-by-step instructions ( like imperative programming) you specify the desired
    result, and the underlying system figures out the steps to get there. 

    Ex: A SQL statement 
        "SELECT * FROM users WHERE ate > 18" 
        Here we describe what you want and not how to retrive it. 

    HTML : you describes the structures and content of a webpage not how to render it. 

## Rust: ( Declarative Programming)

Rust is primarily an **imperative and systems programming** language, meaning it usually emphasized how you
do things, with explicit control over memory, performance and control flow. 

How ever Rust also supports declarative styles, mainly through **macros and functional programming
concepts** and there are librarires and idioms that encourage a declerative approach.

### Declarative aspects in Rust:

1. Macros ( Declarative Macros )
    - Rust's "macro_rules!" macros allow you to write **Declarative macros** which specify what pattern
      of code should expand  to, rather than procedural instructions. 

    - These mactos declare rules for code transformation, making it easier to generate repetitive code
      of domain-specific languages inside Rust.

    - Ex:
    ```rust 
    macro_rules! say_hello {
        () => {
            println!("Hello World!");
        };
    }

    fn main() {
        say_hello!();
    }
    ```
    - You're declaring what patter you want expanded, not describing how to expand step-by-step.

2. Functional style with iterators and closures:
    - Rust Iterator adapters ( `map`, `filter`, `fold`, ...) support declarative style of processing
      collections.
    
    - Instead of writing explicit loops and counters, you declare transformation on data. 

    - Example:
    ```rust 
        let numbers = vec![1,2,3,4,5];
        let evens: Vec<_> = numbers.iter()
            .filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0 )
            .map(|x| x*2)
            .collect();
    ```
    - Here you declare what you want to do: filter even numbers and double them, rather then writing the
      exact looping steps.

3. Pattern matching:
    - Rust `match` statement lets you declaratively express different behaviors based on the structure
      of values.

    - Instead of writing if-else chains with complex conditions, you declare how different patterns
      should be hadnled.

    - Example: 
    ```rust 
        let some_value = Some(42);

        match some_value {
            Some(x) => println!("Val is {}", x),
            None => println!("No Value"),
        }
    ```
    - This is more declarative then imperative if-else because you describe what cases you handle.

### When does Rust tend to be more imperative?

- When you manage memory explicitly using `unsafe`
- When You write explicit loops and mutable state.
- When dealing with sytem-level tasks requiring precise control.

## Summary 

- Rust isn't purely declarative bur offers many declarative tools and idioms.

- You write what transformations you want on data with iterators.

- you declare rules with macros. 

- You handle data cases declaratively with patterns matching. 



# Declarative Attributes:

- These are types of matadata that you can attach to various parts of your code (like functions, structs,
  modules, crates, ...) to influence how the compiler treats that code. They are called **declaratively**
  because they _declare_ information about the item they're attached to, rather than performing imperative
  logic.

    ```rust 
    #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
    struct MyStruct {
        value: i32,
    }
    ```
- `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]` : is a declarative attribute telling the *compiler* to automatically implement
  the `Debug` and `Clone` traits for `MyStruct`

- What is it used for:

- Declarative attributes in Rust serve a variety of purposes:

    1. code generation: 
    ```rust 
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] 
    struct Point {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }
    ```
    Tells the compiler to generate implementations of the `Debug` and `PartialEq` traits.

    2. Conditional Compilation:
    ```rust 
    #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
    fn do_something() {
        // Windows-specific code
    }
    ```
    Only compiles if the target is windows.

    3. Lint Control:
    ```rust 
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    fn unused_function() {
        // This won't trigger a warning
    }
    ```
    4. Macro annotations:
    ```rust 
    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() {
        // async runtime setup by tokio
    }
    ```
    Applies a procedural macro ( In this case from `tokio`) to transform the function.

Summary:

- Declarative attributes are way to annotate rust code with metadata.

- They influence compilation behaviour, generate code, control warnings and more 

- Syntax: `#[attribute]` for outer attributes and `#![attribute]` for inner attributes.
