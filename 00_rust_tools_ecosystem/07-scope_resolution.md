# Scope resolution operator "::"

- `::` operator is called the "path separator" or "scope resolution operator".

- In Rust, the `::` operator is used to separate the components of a path, which can be a module path, a
  type path or a function path. For example:

    ```rust
    my_module::my_function();
    ```

`my_module` is a module, and `my_function` is a function inside that module. 
The `::` operator is used to separate the module name from the function name.

- In C++, the `::` operator is also called the "scope resolution operator". 
- the c++ usage is slightly different from Rust.
- In C++, the `::` operator is used to specify the scope of a name, such as a class, function, or variable. 

    For example:
    ```cpp 
        std::cout << "Hello, world!";
    ```
`std` is a namespace, and `cout` is an object inside that namespace. 
The `::` operator is used to specify that `cout` is a member of the `std` namespace.

- In C++, the `::` operator can also be used to access static members of a class, or to specify the scope of
  a function or variable in a nested scope.

### Comparison  between C++ and Rust:

- Here are some key differences between the `::` operator in Rust and C++:

- In Rust, the `::` operator is used to separate the components of a path, 
  whereas in C++, it is used to specify the scope of a name.

- In Rust, the `::` operator is used to access modules, types, and functions, 
  whereas in C++, it is used to access namespaces, classes, and static members.

- In Rust, the `::` operator is used to specify the absolute path of a name,
  whereas in C++, it is used to specify the relative path of a name.

Here are some examples to illustrate the differences:

Rust:
```rust
my_module::my_function(); // access a function in a module
std::collections::HashMap; // access a type in a module
```
C++:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, world!"; // access an object in a namespace
MyClass::myStaticMethod(); // access a static method in a class
```
While the `::` operator is used in both Rust and C++ to access names in a scope, its usage and semantics 
are slightly different between the two languages.

### Design philosophy:

- Both languages have there pros and cons, and the :: operator us used in different ways to achive different
  goals:

- C++: 
    Pros:
    * Namespace resolution: help resolve namespace, classes and functions.
    * Class scope resolution: used to access static members of a class, helping to avoid ambiquity with
      instance members.
    * Function scope resolution: used to specify the scope of a function which helps to avoid conflicts with
      other functions with same names.
    Cons:
    * Verbose Code: the code can become verbose due to frequent use of :: operator to specify scope.
    * Namespace Pollution: a namespace is cluttered with many unrelated names.

- Rust:
    Pros:
    * Module resolution: resolve module conflicts by specifying the exact module where  a name is defined.
    * Type resolution: uses to access types, which help to avoid ambiguity with other types.
    * Function resolution: used to specify the scope of a function, which helps avoid conflicts with other
      functions with same names.
    * Concise Code: the code is more Concise by using :: operator to specify path.
    * helps to organize modules in a hierarchical structure making it easy to navigate and understand the
      code base.
    Cons:
    * Steeper learning cuve: can be un-familiar to developers not used to c++ or other language.
    * Path complexity: usage of ::  can lead to complex paths, which can be difficult to read and
      understand.

- Comparison:
    Both languages use the :: operator to achieve different goals, and the choice depends on the development
    team.
    Rust usa of :: is more elegant and concise. The path-based approach to modules organization and types
    resolution makes it easier to navigate and understand the codebase, and the :: operator is the essential
    part of that approach.
