# Macros in Rust:
---

### üîç **‚ÄúMacros in Rust are substantially different from macros in C.‚Äù**

Rust's macros are **not just simple text substitution** like C macros. In C:

```c
#define SQUARE(x) x * x
```

This is pure **text replacement**, which can lead to issues:

```c
int result = SQUARE(1 + 2); // expands to 1 + 2 * 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 (wrong!)
```

---

### üå≥ **‚ÄúThey work on the syntax tree and are hence not prone to substitution issues.‚Äù**

Rust macros operate on the **abstract syntax tree (AST)**. This means:

* The Rust compiler understands the **structure** of the code inside a macro.
* There is no raw text substitution‚ÄîRust macros generate **valid, structured Rust code**, avoiding 
  problems like unintended precedence or naming conflicts.

So Rust's macro system is **safer and more powerful**.

### üõ†Ô∏è **‚ÄúCan be used for static code generation, as they integrate nicely with the strict type system.‚Äù**

Because Rust macros understand the code structure and integrate with the type system, you can:

* Generate repetitive or boilerplate code at compile time.
* Define complex logic once and reuse it with different types or parameters.
* Still catch **type errors** at compile time, unlike C where macro expansion might produce invalid code 
  that fails silently or at runtime.

For example:

```rust
macro_rules! create_function {
    ($name:ident) => {
        fn $name() {
            println!("You called {:?}()", stringify!($name));
        }
    };
}

create_function!(foo);
create_function!(bar);

fn main() {
    foo();
    bar();
}
```

This generates two functions at compile time.

### ‚úçÔ∏è **‚ÄúIn addition to the built-in macros, the programmer can easily define his/her own macros.‚Äù**

Rust has built-in macros like `println!`, `vec!`, `format!`, etc.

But you can also define:

* **Declarative macros** using `macro_rules!` (simpler).
* **Procedural macros** for more advanced use, like deriving traits automatically (`#[derive(Debug)]`), attribute-like macros, or function-like macros.

Rust macros are powerful tools for **safe, reusable, and type-aware code generation**, offering a major 
advantage over C-style macros.
